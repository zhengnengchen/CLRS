Sorting: Ranking exam grades of a list of student.  
Computing a convex hull: In obejct detection, given a face or an object, the object detection task is to find the boundary of object which is represented in a set of points.

In a real-world setting, efficiency can be measured by the ability of achieving more tasks under the lowest cost of resources which can be time, energy or money. Suppose there is a computing mission running on a cloud computing platform. Time needed for computing one specific kind of problems are fixed to some extent. However, a cloud computing platform could be more competitive if it uses less energy to compute the same computing task compared with other platforms.

Vector  
pros: Serizilized restored in memory. Good for parallel computing. Easily access to one item within vector using subscript index.  
cons: Deleting a item in the middle of vector is inefficient.

# 1.1-4
The shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are similar because both problems' solutions are finding a path in a graph with lowest weight cost. Two problems are different because the shortest-path problem starts with a specific node and ends with another node and finds a path with lowest cost among all paths from starting node to ending node while the traveling-salesman problem finds a path passing through a set of points with lowest costs.

There exists a optimal solution for hortest-path problem. And traveling-salesman problem does not have an efficient algorithm so that only a approximate solution can be brought up.
