> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

Sorting: Ranking exam grades of a list of student.

Computing a convex hull: In obejct detection, given a face or an object, the object detection task is to find the boundary of object which is represented in a set of points.

> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world limitations.

In a real-world setting, efficiency can be measured by the ability of achieving more tasks under the lowest cost of resources which can be time, energy or money. Suppose there is a computing mission running on a cloud computing platform. Time needed for computing one specific kind of problems are fixed to some extent. However, a cloud computing platform could be more competitive if it uses less energy to compute the same computing task compared with other platforms.

# 1.1-3
> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Vector

pros: Serizilized restored in memory. Good for parallel computing. Easily access to one item within vector using subscript index.

cons: Deleting a item in the middle of vector is inefficient.

# 1.1-4
> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

The shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are similar because both problems' solutions are finding a path in a graph with lowest weight cost. Two problems are different because the shortest-path problem starts with a specific node and ends with another node and finds a path with lowest cost among all paths from starting node to ending node while the traveling-salesman problem finds a path passing through a set of points with lowest costs.

# 1.1-5
> Come up woth a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

There exists a optimal solution for hortest-path problem. And traveling-salesman problem does not have an efficient algorithm so that only a approximate solution can be brought up.
