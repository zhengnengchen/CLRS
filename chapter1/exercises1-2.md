Google map. It use shortest-path algorithm to find best route from one address to another address.

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?8n%5E2) steps, while merge sort runs in 64n lgn steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
